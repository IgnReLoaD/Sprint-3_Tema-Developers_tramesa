Place your javascripts in this folder.

Use the helper functions found in the /includes/functions.php file to find the 
correct path in the system.

h3. Example of usage

<html>
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="<?php echo get_javascript('jquery-1.4.1.min.js');?>"></script>
</head>
<body>
  Your body data here.
</body>
</html>

As you can see, the helper function get_javascript needs to be called, with the
script you want to load as parameter.
