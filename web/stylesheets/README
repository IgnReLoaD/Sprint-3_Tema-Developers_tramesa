Place your stylesheets in this folder.

Use the helper functions found in the /includes/functions.php file to find the 
correct path in the system.

h3. Example of usage

<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="<?php echo get_stylesheet('stylesheet.css'); ?>" />
</head>
<body>
  Your body data here.
</body>
</html>

As you can see, the helper function get_stylesheet needs to be called, with the
stylesheet you want to load as parameter.
